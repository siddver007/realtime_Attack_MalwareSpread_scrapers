# Scrapers for Realtime Attacks and Malware Spread Data
This repository contain scrapers for collecting Real-time Attacks and Malware Spread Data provided by Norse Corp, Check Point Software Technologies,  Malwarebytes, Fortinet, and LookingGlass Cyber Solutions, Inc. **These scrapers are made for educational purposes only.**

## How to Use
- These are Python 3 scripts, so Python 3 must be installed before running these scripts.
- Install the dependencies written in the **requirements.txt file** prior to running the scripts. Either install each of them manually or simply run **pip install -r requirements.txt** for an automated install of all the dependencies.
- Run the scripts. 

## Some useful notes
These scrapers will print as well as create CSV files on your local system containing the scraped data. A new file is created for a new day i.e. separate files are created for separate days. This segregates the data date-wise. The timezone being used is **UTC**. E.g. if the date is January 10, 2017, a file with filename **checkpoint_dump_2017-01-10** will be created and this file will contain the scraped data for this day. Now, the date becomes January 11, 2017 i.e. the next day; a file with name **checkpoint_dump_2017-01-11** will be created, containing the data for this day. And so on...

## Other notes
- Updated checkpoint.py. If checkpoint.py raises an exception "Invalid WebSocket Header", then as a workaround just comment out "raise WebSocketException("Invalid WebSocket Header")" line in \_handshake.py file present inside "python3.5/site-packages/websocket/" directory.

- Updated lookingGlassCyber_scraper.py. Was causing "SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED" error. So removed SSL certificate verification by adding "ssl.\_create_default_https_context = ssl.\_create_unverified_context" line for "urllib" request and "sslopt={"cert_reqs": ssl.CERT_NONE}" for "websocket". This is not the ideal solution and is an insecure fix. So a better and secure way to fix this is to run the "/Applications/Python 3.6/Install Certificates.command" command to install the curated bundle of default root certificates. I haven't tested the latter solution (the secure one), but it should work.
