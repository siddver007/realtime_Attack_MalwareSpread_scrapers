# Scrapers for Realtime Attacks and Malware Spread Data
This repository contain scrapers for collecting Real-time Attacks and Malware Spread Data provided by Norse Corp, Check Point Software Technologies,  Malwarebytes, Fortinet, and LookingGlass Cyber Solutions, Inc. **These scrapers are made for educational purposes only.**

## How to Use
- These are Python 3 scripts, so Python 3 must be installed before running these scripts.
- Install the dependencies written in the **requirements.txt file** prior to running the scripts. Either install each of them manually or simply run **pip install -r requirements.txt** for an automated install of all the dependencies.
- Run the scripts. 

## Some useful notes
These scrapers will print as well as create CSV files on your local system containing the scraped data. A new file is created for a new day i.e. separate files are created for separate days. This segregates the data date-wise. The timezone being used is **UTC**. E.g. if the date is January 10, 2017, a file with filename **checkpoint_dump_2017-01-10** will be created and this file will contain the scraped data for this day. Now, the date becomes January 11, 2017 i.e. the next day; a file with name **checkpoint_dump_2017-01-11** will be created, containing the data for this day. And so on...
